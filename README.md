# Random Distribution Generator

This project focuses on generating random variables according to specified probability distributions. It includes tools for visualization and testing different distributions.

## Features

- **Random Variable Generation**: Create random variables based on various predefined probability distributions using the `DistRand` class.
- **Visualization**: Plot and visualize these distributions using `matplotlib`.
- **Testing**: Validate the generated distributions with the `DistributionsTests` class.

## Requirements

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
